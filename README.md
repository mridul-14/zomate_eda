This is my approach to the Zomato dataset on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/himanshupoddar/zomato-bangalore-restaurants).
Here I've produced some insights from the dataset. I have used the original data for the most part but there are also some fields that I generated on my own.
I'm hoping I'll be updating this script later and do some kind of predictive analysis.
